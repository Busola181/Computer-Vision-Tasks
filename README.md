# Video Annotation using Object Detection with YOLO

This project implements a video annotation tool that uses object detection to automatically annotate objects in videos. The project leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model from Ultralytics for real-time object detection.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Automatically annotate video frames with bounding boxes and labels using YOLO object detection.
  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Real-time object detection on video streams.
  - Automatic annotation with bounding boxes and labels.
  - Support for various video formats.
  - Configurable detection thresholds and model parameters.

- **Framework and Tools:**  
  - **YOLO from Ultralytics:** For object detection.
  - **OpenCV:** For video processing and annotation.
  - **Python:** Core programming language.
  - **Other Dependencies:** [List any other libraries or dependencies.]
